# Computer_Vision
Difference Between 
Computer Vison is used to analyze images and video to extract knowldge from them 
Computing with images and extracting them , infirmation, interepreting and analysisi of scene
Write program that can intrepert images
Understanding of images , while differengt image processing is manipulation of images .
Manipulation of images are core 
Extract images from imagery:
a. Survillence
Building 3D representations
b. Motion caputed assisted

State of ART:
a. OCR(Optical Charatcter recognition)
techonlogy to convert scanned docs to text
Licesnse plate
Face detection

Object recognition:
  augmented rality
  in mobiles object
  google glass
  
  Special effects: shape capture, motion capture, google Earth imagery(3D modeling)
    Vision in acr(Mobileeye)
    
   Sports :
   
   Kinetic: crated a depth images> skeleteal inmages from depth imahes
  
 Security and Survillence
 Medical imaging
  image guided surgery

Vision is important
